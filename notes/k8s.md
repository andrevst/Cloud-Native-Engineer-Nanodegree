## Deploy an application

Kubernetes provides a rich collection of resources that are used to deploy, configure, and manage an application. Some of the widely used resources are:

- Pods - the atomic element within a cluster to manage an application
- Deployments & ReplicaSets - oversees a set of pods for the same application
- Services & Ingress - ensures connectivity and reachability to pods
- Configmaps & Secrets - pass configuration to pods
- Namespaces - provides a logical separation between multiple applications and their resources
- Custom Resource Definition (CRD) - extends Kubernetes API to support custom resources
